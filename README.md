Ember is born from a stray ember from a braai, whose aim is to get bigger and bigger until the 
ultimate goal of a global warming is achieved. It is a mix of a classic 
platformer and a modern fast paced speed runner. the core mechanic that sets this
game apart from other platformers, is Ember's heat bar. Which is affected by enemy 
projectiles, time, Ember's special abilites, burning enemies.

# Installation
## Building the Game 

The game was developed using Unity editor version 2021.3.10f1. 
The build settings have been preconfigured for correct scene management, so the build process is fairly simple:
In the editor window go to > File > Build Settings...
In the build window ensure that the correct target platform is selected (Linux, MacOS, or Windows) 
Then click Build, choose a destination folder for the executable and Unity will take care of the rest. 

## Downloading Pre-Built Versions
Prebuilt versions can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZJalPr4XTDQgSvJg4brZyOYEnm5g4qIO?usp=sharing 
Under the desired platform folder, download all the contents and run the executable.

# User Guide
The game opens up to a menu where you can start a new game, load a save, change the game settings or quit. If the game has a save file then "Load" will be an option - to save the game use the pause menu to save during a level before exiting. On "New Game" the game will start from the begining. There are then 3 levels and 4 Cutscenes to progress through to the end of the game where you will return to the main menu.

## Controls
Ember has the basic movement of run left, run right and jump. From level 1 he can also use heat to jump mid-air for a maximum of 3 extra jumps and he can shoot a fireball at enemies.

 - A > Run Left
 - D > Run Right
 - Space > Jump
 - Left Click > Shoot Fireball
 - Right Click > Heat Wave
 - Shift > Dash
